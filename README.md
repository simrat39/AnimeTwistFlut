## Official Anime Twist android application
#### Built with flutter. Fast and beautiful.

## Downloading

Grab the latest apk from the assets [here](https://github.com/simrat39/AnimeTwistFlut/releases).

Make sure to select the correct apk while downloading.

<i> For newer phones: </i> <b> app-arm64-v8a-release.apk </b> will work fine. <br/>
<i> For Smart Tvs and older phones: </i> <b> app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk </b> will work fine. <br/>
<i> For other special phones and emulators: </i> <b> app-x86_64-release.apk </b> will be the best bet. <br/>

## Building

This app is built on flutter's dev channel, therefore before compiling, a switch to the dev channel is needed.

    flutter channel dev
    flutter upgrade --force

Anime Twist requires a secret key to be provided or else video streams wont work. We provide the secret key at compile time with the dart-define flag. We can't show the key for obvious reasons, if you need it for serious development of the video player, please contact someone from the dev team.

    flutter pub get
    flutter run --dart-define=KEY='<secret_key>' --release
